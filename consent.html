<u>DESCRIPTION:</u> You are invited to participate in a research study on everyday decision-making and reward learning.  The overall purpose of the research is to learn more about factors that influence the way we make decisions in every day life. Additionally, we are investigating how the brain learns from previous experiences with reward to value stimuli and make decisions based on this information. In this study, you may be asked to answer questionnaires. You also may be asked to call to mind memories or imaginations. Finally, you may be asked to respond to visually-presented stimuli to indicate which you expect to give more reward (either points or money) or to indicate the amount of reward you expect to receive based on a single stimulus.<br><br>
