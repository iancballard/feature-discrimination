                <p>But I only hide in some houses, and you are going to have to learn which ones. Lucky for you, you can tell houses apart is by the posters on their walls, like this one</p>
                <img style="height: 40%;" id="cue" src="/fd/pics/house_face.jpg">
                <p>Paying attention to these posters can help you earn money! If you are sure I am hiding in a house based on the posters, you can press the space bar right away and then you will be sure to catch me! That is, if you press space before I appear, you are guaranteed to win <b>25&#162</b>. But, if you are wrong and press space for a house I am not hiding behind, I will charge you <b>25&#162</b>. </p>
				<p>Responding before I appear will guarantee that you win money, but if you respond all the time and make mistakes, you will lose money.</p>
				<p>So, if you can learn which houses I like to hide behind, you can earn way more money! </p>
