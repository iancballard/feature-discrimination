                <p>Hello! My name is Billy the Bug and I am the fastest bug in the world!</p>
                <p>In this experiment, you are going to try to catch me. If you are fast enough to get me, then you will earn REAL money. If you are very quick and very clever, you could earn up to $3!</p>
                <p>But play fair! We reserve the right to withhold payment of the bonus for poor performance. Please do not respond continuously. Please try not to miss any responses. If you miss too many responses, or have impossibly fast responses, or have otherwise very poor performance, we will withhold payment of the bonus.</p>
				<p><b>Pay attention to all of instructions!</b> We will ask you to describe the game before you start, and we will withhold payment of the bonus for descriptions missing major parts.</p>
