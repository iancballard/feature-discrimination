                <p>In this experiment, you will be asked to respond to a target while viewing images. There will be 2 parts with separate instructions. </p>
                <p>In the second part, you could earn real money. Responding quickly to the target earns 5&#162. The faster you respond, the more likely you are to win. You could win between $1 and $3 for good performance.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to withhold payment of the bonus for poor performance. Please do not respond continuously. Please try not to miss any responses. <b>If you miss too many responses, or have impossibly fast responses, or have otherwise very poor performance, we will withhold payment of the bonus.</b> </p>
                <p>It is important that you pay close attention in order to earn the maximum possible bonus. <b>That is, the closer you pay attention, the more money you could win. </b></p>
